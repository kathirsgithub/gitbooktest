# Edits

**Edits** menu stores all your saved drafts, merges and archived drafts.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Drafts" %}
A **draft** is an editable version of your content only accessible by your members, and is automatically created once you start writing \(first letter on the editor, creation of a new page, uploading a picture, etc.\).  
  
Doing a **Save** only records your work as drafts. A draft can contain one or more edits you have made.

# ðŸ“ƒ Pages

A **page** is a place where all your content goes on.

You can create unlimited pages in a Space. Once a page is created, you can just start typing! 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important:**   
The first page you create in a space cannot be reordered or nested in the left panel.
{% endhint %}

You can format a page with in-built formatting options.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also type a page using Markdown language.
{% endhint %}

## Renaming a Page

You can change a page name by just changing the title of the page or by clicking **More** option in the right panel.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can set or change a page slug under **More** menu.
{% endhint %}

## Grouping of Pages

Pages can be grouped or indexed under different names. 

{% hint style="info" %}
A page can be nested under other pages.
{% endhint %}

## Default Templates

While start typing a new page, you can either start by choosing a available template or just type to continue with an empty page.

## Importing a Page

You can create a new page by importing files such as Markdown, ZIP, HTML, DOCX or content from

![](../../.gitbook/assets/import-options.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
GitBook does not connect to above services.   
It only allows you upload files from your local storage.   
You should keep your required file in your computer before importing.
{% endhint %}

## Exporting a Page

A page can be exported as only PDF.

## Save and Merge options

GitBook does not autosave your works. Each time you edit or make changes to your Space or Page, you must manually **Save** your work.

### What does a Save do?

Doing a **Save** only records your work as drafts. A draft can contain one or more edits you have made.

A **draft** is an editable version of your content only accessible by your members, and is automatically created once you start writing \(first letter on the editor, creation of a new page, uploading a picture, etc.\).

{% hint style="info" %}
**Saving** a work does not reflect on your shared links.
{% endhint %}

### What does a Merge do?

Doing a **Merge** will combine all your drafts and saves your work completely.

{% hint style="info" %}
All merges are stored and you can restore any merge and rollback to it.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Merging** a work completely saves your work and updates all your shared links.
{% endhint %}
